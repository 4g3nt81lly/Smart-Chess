/**
 * A concrete subtype of {@link Player} that represents a Chess-playing agent that makes move
 * "intelligently" and fully-autonomously.<p>
 * This class serves as a base class for all agents. Its default implementation na√Øvely selects
 * random (and legal) movements from the set of available ones depending on the current state of
 * the chessboard.<p>
 * An agent need not be aware of the state of the entire game, which is why only the chessboard is
 * provided. An implication of this being that, in the case of a stochastic agent (i.e. randomness
 * is involved in its decision-making process), it can never tell if the current state they receive
 * is a result of a regular turn or an undo/redo action (initiated by a human player). If an agent
 * needs to maintain any non-volatile state information, they can do so internally.
 * @apiNote All agents <b>must</b> extend this class and implement the required method
 * {@link #getPlayerMove(Chessboard)}, which serves as a supplier method to {@link ChessGame}.
 * Beware that, generally, one <i>can but should not</i> make calls to the default implementation
 * of this method, unless one has a very good reason to do so.<p>
 * Agents can be annotated with {@link AgentInfo} to customize the display name of the agent, see
 * {@link AgentInfo} for details.<p>
 * Subtypes of {@link Agent} may implement their own custom methods and maintain their own states
 * that are crucial to their functioning. Note that agents will be held responsible for managing
 * persistence, i.e. serializing and deserializing their custom states, if applicable.
